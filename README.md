IdeaShare is a website for sharing ideas...

This website was developed during CodeLouisville May 2018 class.

IdeaShare is developed for sharing ideas between vistors and discuss to develop the idea further.
The basic website is developed with required pages for uploading and sharing ideas, as mockup. Can not upload new ideas here now.

Used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for developing this front end prototype. Back end is not developed as of July 2018.
Following are the features added in the website.

1. Thumps up button adds positive numbers in GREEN color. Right now, there are no limitation on thumps up maximum clicks. Objective is to add one positive number per user login per idea is allowed.
2. Thumps down button adds negative numbers in RED color. Right now, there are no limitation on thumps down maximum clicks. Objective is to add one negative number per user login per idea is allowed.
3. Has separate page for submitting new ideas.
4. Has separate page for viewing submitted own ideas.
5. Has main (index.html) page for viewing all ideas.
6. Media query is incorporated in css file for viewing in small/portable screen devices.

The website needs further development with back end capabilities.
